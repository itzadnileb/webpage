      <dt><strong>Fullname</strong>: Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni</dt>
      <dt><strong>Born</strong>: March 6, 1475 in Caprese Michelangelo, Italy</dt>

    He was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of 
    the High Renaissance born in the Republic of Florence, who 
    exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of 
    Western art. His artistic versatility was of such a high order 
    that he is often considered a contender for the title of the 
    archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival, the fellow 
    Florentine, Leonardo da Vinci. Several scholars have described 
    Michelangelo as the greatest artist of his age and even as the 
    greatest artist of all time.

      <dt><strong>Fullname</strong>: Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno 
        María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y 
        Picasso</dt>
      <dt><strong>Born</strong>: October 25, 1881 in Málaga, Spain</dt>
      <dt><strong>Died</strong>: April 8, 1973 in Mougins, France</dt>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and 
    theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. 
    Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th 
    century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, 
    the invention of constructed sculpture, the 
    co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles 
    that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous 
    works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), 
    and Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of 
    Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish 
    Civil War.

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Fullname</strong>: Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci</dt>
      <dt><strong>Born</strong>: April 15, 1452 in Anchiano, Italy</dt>
      <dt><strong>Died</strong>: May 2, 1519 in Château du Clos Lucé, Amboise, France</dt>
  </p>
    He was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who is 
    widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. 
    The Mona Lisa is the most famous of his works and the most 
    famous portrait ever made. The Last Supper is the most 
    reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian 
    Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. He is also 
    known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on 
    science and invention; these involve a variety of subjects 
    including anatomy, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. 
    Leonardo's collective works compose a contribution to later 
    generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary  
    Michelangelo.
