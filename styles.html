  Like many of the Renaissance masters Michelangelo was an artist who worked with different art forms. Although he primarily considered himself a sculptor, he created some of the greatest fresco paintings and architecture the world has ever seen.

  At the young age of thirteen, when Michelangelo was working in Ghirlandaio's studio, he learnt the technique of painting frescoes and always said he preferred to work this way rather than with oil paints. In his frescoes Michelangelo never created his forms with a soft focus and believed it was more important to create figures with clear outlines, which was a Florentine tradition.
  
  When Michelangelo created the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel he did not consider himself to be a painter because during his career he had primarily been working with sculpture. Even so this is difficult to believe due to the sheer size and beauty of his art. The Sistine Chapel was painted with bright, light colors that daringly harmonized. Michelangelo painted freely and with great dynamism.
  
  During the high Renaissance there was a marriage between the Catholic religion and Greek mythology. For example, in the Sistine Chapel there is a meeting between God and Adam that is reminiscent of the Classical myths, man and God have been placed together and communicating. Despite the pagan elements, there's a clear Christian message in the piece.
  
  As can be seen in the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel Michelangelo was obsessed with the human form above all else and unlike da Vinci, he rarely spent time working with nature. Despite his irritable personality Michelangelo revered others and wanted to be liked. Thus in all of his works he focused his energies on understanding the form of the human figure. Michelangelo thought that the human body was a beautiful entity that should be naked, or only wearing simple robes.
  
  Thus, like the classical Roman statues Michelangelo's David has been created with a herculean physique. Michelangelo revealed his hero waiting to meet the enemy rather than in victory. Furthermore, he showed David's strength through his sinewy body that reveals the future power he will display. The sculpture of David reveals a relationship between Renaissance art and Greek mythology.
  
  Michelangelo used his advanced knowledge of the human body to create his nudes. Furthermore Michelangelo was primarily interested in how concrete figures could be encompassed within an outside shell. He was liked religious themes and focused on the image of Christ in many of his drawings, frequently drawing the same images until the emotion in his pieces became intense.
  
  Michelangelo had a keen eye for light and shadow and grasped that they can represent volume and shape in both a sculpture and a painting. Thus he created many freestanding sculptures. Whereas Leonardo da Vinci painted his figures with straight axles and lines Michelangelo was more inclined to introduce curves and diagonals. Unlike da Vinci, Michelangelo produced figures that twisted around and complimented each other's forms.

  It was a confluence of influences - from Paul CÃ©zanne and Henri Rousseau, to archaic and tribal art - that encouraged Picasso to lend his figures more structure and ultimately set him on the path towards Cubism, in which he deconstructed the conventions of perspective that had dominated painting since the Renaissance. These innovations would have far-reaching consequences for practically all of modern art, revolutionizing attitudes to the depiction of form in space.
  Picasso's immersion in Cubism also eventually led him to the invention of collage, in which he abandoned the idea of the picture as a window on objects in the world, and began to conceive of it merely as an arrangement of signs that used different, sometimes metaphorical means, to refer to those objects. This too would prove hugely influential for decades to come.
  Picasso had an eclectic attitude to style, and although, at any one time, his work was usually characterized by a single dominant approach, he often moved interchangeably between different styles - sometimes even in the same artwork.
  His encounter with Surrealism, although never transforming his work entirely, encouraged not only the soft forms and tender eroticism of portraits of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter, but also the starkly angular imagery of Guernica (1937), the century's most famous anti-war painting.
  Picasso was always eager to place himself in history, and some of his greatest works, such as Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), refer to a wealth of past precedents - even while overturning them. As he matured he became only more conscious of assuring his legacy, and his late work is characterized by a frank dialogue with Old Masters such as Ingres, Velazquez, Goya, and Rembrandt.

  Da Vinci made a scientific study of light and shadow in nature and realized that objects were not composed of outlines, but were actually three-dimensional and characterized by light and shadow. A technique known as chiaroscuro, this realization and experimentation gave his paintings the soft, lifelike quality that made older works appear flat.

  Leonardo also understood that an object's color and detail changed as it retreated in the distance. Such a technique, called sfumato, was first developed by Flemish and Venetian painters, but with da Vinci's artistic genius, it became a powerful tool that created atmosphere and depth.
  
  Early works:
  In the 1480s Leonardo was given two vital commissions and began another that was highly significant because of its composition. One of these paintings was St. Jerome in the Wilderness. Despite the fact the painting is barely started, the composition is very unusual. The landscape elements, drama and arrangement of figures featured in this work are emulated in another of Leonardo's great unfinished masterpieces, the Adoration of the Magi.
  
  Paintings of the 1490s:
  The most famous work to emerge from this period was The Last Supper. Despite Leonardo's concerns over portraying the faces of the figures, the painting was hailed a masterpiece. Sadly, The Last Supper deteriorated rapidly due to the fact that Leonardo had used materials that were prone to mold and flaking. Nonetheless this image remains one of the most reproduced works of art.
  
  Paintings of the 1500s:
  Da Vinci employed the technique of sfumato (later referred to as Leonardo's smoke) to produce his most renowned artwork, Mona Lisa. Other qualities of this painting are the simple dress, the dramatic scenery, subdued color palette and the extremely smooth nature of the work, where oils have been blended on the surface to hide any trace of the brush stroke.
  
  In the Virgin and Child with St. Anne, which also employs the subtle sfumato technique, the composition is similar to the Mona Lisa in that the figures are set in extremely beautiful surroundings. However, Virgin and Child with St. Anne is rare because there are two figures set on an angle and superimposed.
  
  This work was copied many times and it influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo and Correggio. Moreover, these trends in composition were adopted by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.
  
  Drawings:
  Leonardo created a series of compositions of the Virgin and Child and before painting, he would work out his arrangement in a sketch. He was a creative draftsman and had numerous notepads crammed full of small drawings.
  
  He carried out several studies referred to as "caricatures" because, although embellished, they appear to be drawn from live models. Vasari stated that Leonardo would often follow people he deemed interesting and would make sketches of them all day long.
